    "We move a horizontal line from the bottom of the chart to the top.",
    "For each point we reach, the number of intersections might change, so we have to count it.",
    "If a point we just reached is lower than its previous/next point, the number of intersections increases.",
    "If a point we just reached is higher than its previous/next point, the number of intersections decreases.",
    "There is also another solution using Fenwick Tree."

    "Try to answer the query of asking GCD of a subarray in <code>O(1)</code> using sparse tables and preprocessing.",
    "For every index <code>L</code>, let’s find the subarray starting at the index <code>L</code> and maximizing gcd-sum.",
    "Use the fact that if <code>L</code> is fixed, then by adding one more element to the end of a subarray, two things can happen: the gcd remains the same as the last gcd or becomes at least half of the last one.",
    "Now we can use binary search to find the last index <code>R</code> such that gcd of the elements of <code>nums[L..R]</code> would be equal to <code>nums[L]</code>.",
    "Now add <code>nums[R + 1]</code> to the current subarray and continue the process to find the last index that has the same gcd as the current gcd of elements."

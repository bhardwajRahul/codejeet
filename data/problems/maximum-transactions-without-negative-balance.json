    "Scan the list left to right, keeping a running <code>balance</code> and a container <code>accepted</code> that tracks the sizes of negative transactions you have taken.",
    "Always take nonnegative transactions; they increase <code>balance</code> and the total count.",
    "If a negative <code>t</code> can be paid (<code>balance + t >= 0</code>), accept it and record its absolute value in <code>accepted</code>.",
    "If a negative would make the balance go below zero, but you previously accepted a larger negative, replace that larger one with the current smaller one (restore balance, swap in the smaller): this trade increases the number of transactions you can keep."

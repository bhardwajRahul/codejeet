    "Calculate the shortest path for each pair of characters <code>(source[i], target[i])</code>. The sum of cost over all <code>i</code> in the range <code>[0, source.length - 1]</code>. If there is no path between <code>source[i]</code> and <code>target[i]</code>, the answer is <code>-1</code>.",
    "Any shortest path algorithms will work since we only have <code>26</code> nodes. Since we only have at most <code>26 * 26</code> pairs, we can save the result to avoid re-calculation.",

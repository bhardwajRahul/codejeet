    "We are asked to count the number of sequences of length <code>k + 1</code> that start from <code>(x<sub>s</sub>, y<sub>s</sub>)</code> and end with <code>(x<sub>d</sub>, y<sub>d</sub>)</code>. i.e., <code>(x<sub>s</sub>, y<sub>s</sub>), (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), ..., (x<sub>k - 1</sub>, y<sub>k - 1</sub>), (x<sub>d</sub>, y<sub>d</sub>)</code>.",
    "The key point is to see <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> separately.",
    "Suppose we do <code>i</code> vertical moves and <code>k - i</code> horizontal moves.",
    "In each vertical move, we change only <code>y</code>. Now let's count the number of sequences of length <code>i + 1</code> that start with <code>source[2]</code> and end with <code>dest[2]</code>. Let's call this number <code>vertical_count</code>.",
    "Do the same for horizontal moves and let it be <code>horizontal_count</code>.",
    "For each <code>i</code>, the number of ways would be <code>vertical_count * horizontal_count * C(n, i)</code> since the order of vertical and horizontal moves could be arbitrary."

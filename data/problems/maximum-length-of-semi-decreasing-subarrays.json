    "First, solve the problem assuming <code>nums</code> contains distinct values.",
    "Make a new array with each element being the pair <code>(nums[i], i)</code> for every <code>i</code> and call it <code>num_ind</code>.",
    "Sort <code>num_ind</code> in decreasing order.",
    "Iterate over <code>num_ind</code> and store a variable that represents the minimum index (i.e. min of <code>num_ind[i].second</code>) that has been iterated until now. Call it <code>min_index</code>",

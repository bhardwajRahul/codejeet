    "You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted. What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution?",
    "If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution."

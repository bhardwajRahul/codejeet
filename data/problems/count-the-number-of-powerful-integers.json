    "Let <code>dp[i][j]</code> be the number of integers that have <code>i</code> digits (with allowed leading 0s) and <code>j</code> refers to the comparison between the current number and the prefix of <code>x</code>, <code>j == 0</code> if the i-digit number formed currently is identical to the leftmost <code>i</code> digits of <code>x</code>, else if <code>j ==1</code> it means the i-digit number is smaller than the leftmost <code>i</code> digits of <code>x</code>.",

If it doesn’t, then I have added one new course. Increment the currentTotalTime with duration of current course.",
    "2. If it exceeds deadline, I can swap current course with current courses that has biggest duration.</br>\r\n* No harm done and I might have just reduced the currentTotalTime, right? </br>\r\n* What preprocessing do I need to do on my course processing order so that this swap is always legal?"

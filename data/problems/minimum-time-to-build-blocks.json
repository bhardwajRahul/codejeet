    "A greedy approach will not work as the examples show.",
    "Try all possible moves using DP.",
    "For the DP state, dp[i][j] is the minimum time cost to build the first i blocks using j workers.",
    "In one step you can either assign a worker to a block or choose a number of workers to split.",
    "If you choose to assign a worker to a block it is always better to assign him to the block with the maximum time so we sort the array before using DP.",
    "To optimize the solution from O(n^3) to O(n^2) notice that if you choose to split, it is always better to split all the workers you have."

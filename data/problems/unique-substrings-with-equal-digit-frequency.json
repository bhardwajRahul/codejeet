    "With the constraints, could we try every substring?",
    "Yes, checking every substring has runtime O(n^2), which will pass.",
    "How can we make sure we only count unique substrings?",
    "Use a set to store previously counted substrings. Hashing a string s of length m takes O(m) time. Is there a fast way to compute the hash of s if we know the hash of s[0..m - 2]?",
    "Use a rolling hash."

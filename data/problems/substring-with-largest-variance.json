    "Think about how to solve the problem if the string had only two distinct characters.",
    "If we replace all occurrences of the first character by +1 and those of the second character by -1, can we efficiently calculate the largest possible variance of a string with only two distinct characters?",
    "Now, try finding the optimal answer by taking all possible pairs of characters into consideration."

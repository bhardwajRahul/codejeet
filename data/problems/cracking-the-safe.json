    "We can think of this problem as the problem of finding an Euler path (a path visiting every edge exactly once) on the following graph: there are <code>k<sup>n-1</sup></code> nodes with each node having <code>k</code> edges.  It turns out this graph always has an Eulerian circuit (path starting where it ends.)\r\n\r\nWe should visit each node in \"post-order\" so as to not get stuck in the graph prematurely."

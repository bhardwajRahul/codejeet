    "Find the prime factors of <code>n</code>.",
    "If there is a prime factor <code>p</code> such that <code>p >= 11</code>, the answer is <code>-1</code>. Since there are no digits whose products equal <code>p</code>.",
    "Factors <code>5</code> and <code>7</code> should be included in the answer since their product with any number bigger than <code>1</code> is a 2-digit number.",

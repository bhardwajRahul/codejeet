    "We have three types of operations: increase any <code>occ[x]</code> by 1, decrease any <code>occ[x]</code> by 1, or decrease any <code>occ[x]</code> by 1 and simultaneously increase <code>occ[x + 1]</code> by 1 at the same time. To make <code>s</code> good, we need to make <code>occ</code> good. <code>occ</code> is good if and only if every <code>occ[x]</code> equals either 0 or some constant <code>c</code>.",
    "If you know the value of <code>c</code>, how can you calculate the minimum operations required to make <code>occ</code> good?",
    "Observation 1: It is never optimal to apply the third type of operation (simultaneous decrease and increase) on two continuous elements <code>occ[x]</code> and <code>occ[x + 1]</code>. Instead, we can decrease <code>occ[x]</code> by 1 then increase <code>occ[x + 2]</code> by 1 to achieve the same effect.",
    "Observation 2: It is never optimal to increase an element of <code>occ</code> then decrease it, or vice versa.",
    "Use dynamic programming where <code>dp[i]</code> is the minimum number of operations required to make <code>occ[0..i]</code> good. You will need to use the above observations to come up with the transitions."

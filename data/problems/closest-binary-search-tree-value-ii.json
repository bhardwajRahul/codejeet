    "Consider implement these two helper functions:\r\n<ol type=\"i\"><li><code>getPredecessor(N)</code>, which returns the next smaller node to N.</li>\r\n<li><code>getSuccessor(N)</code>, which returns the next larger node to N.</li>\r\n</ol>",
    "Try to assume that each node has a parent pointer, it makes the problem much easier.",
    "Without parent pointer we just need to keep track of the path from the root to the current node using a stack.",
    "You would need two stacks to track the path in finding predecessor and successor node separately."

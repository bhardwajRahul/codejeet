    "The naive approach is to call <code>isUgly</code> for every number until you reach the n<sup>th</sup> one. Most numbers are <i>not</i> ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.",
    "An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5 from a smaller ugly number.",
    "The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists: L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>.",

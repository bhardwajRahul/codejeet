    "Notice that the order of merging two numbers into their LCM does not matter so we can greedily merge elements to its left if possible.",
    "If a new value is formed, we should recursively check if it can be merged with the value to its left.",
    "To simulate the merge efficiently, we can maintain a stack that stores processed elements. When we iterate through the array, we only compare with the top of the stack (which is the value to its left)."

    "Calculate the number of stepping numbers in the range [1, high] and subtract the number of stepping numbers in the range [1, low - 1].",
    "The main problem is calculating the number of stepping numbers in the range [1, x].",
    "First, calculate the number of stepping numbers shorter than x in length, which can be done using dynamic programming. (dp[i][j] is the number of i-digit stepping numbers ending with digit j).",
    "Finally, calculate the number of stepping numbers that have the same length as x similarly. However, this time we need to maintain whether the prefix (in string) is smaller than or equal to x in the DP state."

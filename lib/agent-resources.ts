> ${SITE_NAME} (${SITE_URL}) is a free interview-prep site for browsing 15,000+ company-wise LeetCode questions from 700+ companies, plus system-design chapters and interview guides.

${SITE_NAME} is not LeetCode, not an official company careers site, and not a coding judge. It does not accept solution submissions on problem pages. Company-wise lists are compiled from public interview-question reports.

## When to use this

Use ${SITE_NAME} when the job is:

- Look up which LeetCode problems a named company asks (Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and 700+ others), ranked by reported frequency
- Compare two companies' interview question overlap before preparing for both
- Filter problems by topic (arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming) or difficulty with company context
- Study system-design interview building blocks (rate limiter, URL shortener, chat, news feed, unique ID generation)
- Read a company-specific or topic-specific written prep guide

Do not use ${SITE_NAME} when the job is:

- Calling a public REST/OpenAPI API or MCP server — none is published; use HTML pages, this file, and the sitemap
- Submitting or judging code against hidden tests (use LeetCode)
- Official hiring, recruiter outreach, or company headcount
- Bulk-downloading /data/ JSON (disallowed in robots.txt)

## Developer resources

- [${SITE_NAME} developer resources](${SITE_URL}/developers): URL patterns, what exists (and does not), authenticated progress/notes APIs
- [llms.txt](${SITE_URL}/llms.txt): this file
- [llms-full.txt](${SITE_URL}/llms-full.txt): longer agent instructions and URL catalog
- [Sitemap](${SITE_URL}/sitemap.xml): indexable URLs
- [robots.txt](${SITE_URL}/robots.txt)

## Optional

- [Home](${SITE_URL}/)
- [Question tracker](${SITE_URL}/dashboard)
- [Company directory](${SITE_URL}/companies)
- [Compare companies](${SITE_URL}/compare)
- [System design](${SITE_URL}/system-design)
- [Blog](${SITE_URL}/blog)
- [About](${SITE_URL}/about)
- [Contact](${SITE_URL}/contact)
- [Privacy](${SITE_URL}/privacy)
- [GitHub](${CONTACT_GITHUB})
- [X / Twitter](${CONTACT_X})

## How an agent should call ${SITE_NAME}

1. Read ${SITE_URL}/llms.txt (this document's short form) and ${SITE_URL}/sitemap.xml.
2. Open a company page at ${SITE_URL}/company/{slug} where slug is lowercase kebab-case (google, amazon, meta).
3. Open a problem page at ${SITE_URL}/problem/{slug} where slug matches the LeetCode title slug (two-sum).
4. Compare two companies at ${SITE_URL}/compare/{alphabetically-first}-vs-{second} (amazon-vs-google).
5. Quote visible page text. Do not invent frequency numbers. Do not tell the user ${SITE_NAME} is affiliated with LeetCode or the employer.

## Authenticated endpoints (human session only)

- GET/POST ${SITE_URL}/api/progress — map of problem slug to solved-at timestamp for the signed-in user
- GET/POST ${SITE_URL}/api/notes — personal notes keyed by problem slug

These require a Clerk session cookie. There is no API key, OAuth app, or MCP transport. Signed-out GET returns empty objects. POST without a session returns 401.

## Identity

- Name: ${SITE_NAME}
- Canonical URL: ${SITE_URL}
